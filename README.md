# This is my course project from Playable Media from ITU

I want to point out the possibly implicit culture approperation when people call chinese "é¾™", or loong, a dragon.

They are two totally different creatures, there is no point call the by one word.

I wan to:
1. Make it obvious, because they are obviously different creatures;
2. Make it repetitive, because I have heard people call Chinese loong a dragon repeatedly in my life;
3. Make it annoying, because this is what I feel when I hear people confuse them.
